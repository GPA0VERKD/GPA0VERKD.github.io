        <h2 class="py-3 mb-4">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I've lived in Seattle, WA for most of my life, and was raised with a
          Vietnamese-American upbringing. I've always been involved with the
          community through church, service groups like National Honor Society,
          and other miscellaneous activities. These helped me to hold a deep
          appreciation for family and community, and gave me the basis for my
          growing leadership skills in the future.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="container my-4">
        <h2 class="py-3 mb-4">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          My hobbies mostly consist of playing music and videogames. I love co-op
          games since I always grew up playing with my older brother! I've also
          been playing music since I was young, but became interested in Jazz
          and more collaborative music during High School.

          Here's a video of me playing piano during a recording session with my
          friends during over the summer!
